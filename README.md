# Solutions for CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

These are my solutions for the [CS231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) class of 2017. The solutions are mostly full, except the pytorch notebooks and the rnn, lstm notebooks in assignment 3. The course notes, the slides and lecture videos are all available and I highly recommend this course for a thorough introduction to visual recognition and deep learning in general.
